# C2C Performance Activity

## Virtual Engagement Data Analysis and Interpretation

Below please find a table of the demographics of students that attend Code2College

To summarize, the enrollment shows an about even split between self-identified males and females. Additionally, a majority of the enrolled students are of an  underrepresnted population. 

The table below shows a disconnect between 73% of students that would still attend college even if it was only offering virtual classes and 86% of students that either agreed or strongly aggreed that in-person learning in college is important. However, this could be interpreted as students having experiences that engaged them in virtual classes. This notion is explained further in the following section.

Looking at the two charts below, 18% of students had participated in C2C in person. Of that 18%, only 14% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they feel a strong connection to staff, volunteers, and other students. However, 53% of students that had not participated in C2C in person

## Achievement Data Analysis and Interpretation

The three charts below show the relationship between attendance and achievement. And though we want to tell ourselves that attendance matters. This particuplar data is telling a different story. In fact, it show the opposite: School C has poor attendance but high achievement; and School A has individuals that perform better than their peers that have a bette attendance record.

Indeed, there is alot happening here. Perhaps too much is assumed and more infom would be required to see a brighter picture.

Some addtional questions to ask would be:
- Accuracy of attendance in each class
- Demographics in relation to accessability of resources (ie. internet access, quiet space, correlation to achievement, attendance, or both)
- Was there a prerequisite to get into the class?
- Scores in previous classes
